# automatic-smart-cart-system
Aim of this project is to find the shortest path to the customer who is busy wasting their time with a good selection process in the supermarket. There are two parts of this project. One is a website where customers can select the foods. After selecting goods using Floyd Warshall's Algorithm, find the shortest path for the slot which stores in. And the second part is a cart which is self driving to the given slot. Then users have to select goods using the website and after going to the supermarket give the id of the cart to the website and then it will send the data to the cart. After that cart will go the given path and park the parking slot which is near to the good section.
